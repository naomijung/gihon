                                Gihon Women Empowerment Kenya was founded in 2015 by 
                                Agnes Gitonga and Lucy Wanjin in Kitengela, Kenya. 
                                Agnes initially set up a feeding program to give 
                                the children in the local area a chance to come and 
                                receive a free meal, but when she noticed that many 
                                women were also queuing up to be fed, she realised 
                                that something had to be done. Lucy and Agnes set out 
                                to create a one-year annual empowerment program that 
                                would improve the lives of the women in Kitengela by 
                                helping them bring in their own income. 
                                <br><br>
                                Gihon is a non-government funded organisation which 
                                focuses on gender-equality and empowering women 
                                through both formal lessons and practical skills. 
                                The women who take part in the program are able 
                                to learn a wide range of new skills that will give 
                                them the tools they need to succeed and achieve 
                                their dreams, all free of charge.
                                <br><br>
                                As the center has grown over the years, Gihon has 
                                initiated other projects as well, including a school
                                program for underprivileged kids in Kitengela and
                                a support group for HIV positive women. Read more about
